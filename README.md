<h2>One Page Website</h2>
This is an example home page for a cat adoption center. I styled it with CSS and included a navbar, a form, and embedded videos. 

<h2>Movie Theatre Site</h2>
This is an example homepage for a Movie Theatre that is styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains components such as a navbar, jumbotron, cards, and dropdowns.

<h2>Coffee Shop Website</h2>
This is an example home page for a coffee shop. It's styled with CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.
