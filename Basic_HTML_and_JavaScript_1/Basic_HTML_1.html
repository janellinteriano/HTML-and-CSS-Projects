Sunsets are my favorite. They fill the sky with beautiful colors 
that blend together nicely. There are many types of color 
variations that make sunsets great.

<b>There are 3 stages when it comes to sunsets.</b> 
The first stage is called "<i>Civil Twilight</i>." Civil twilight occurs after sunset when it
becomes slightly darker outside, but your surroundings are still visible. This is when
streetlights come on and people are able to see more clearly.
