		<h1>Kitten Fun Facts</h1>
			<p>Here are some cool facts about kittens that you may not have heard of.</p>

			<h3>Kittens Are Born Blind.</h3>
				<p>Most kittens begin to open their eyes around 7-10 days after birth.
				Their vision remains blurry until they are about 10 weeks old. This is 
				when their vision starts to fully develop!</p>

			<h3>All Kittens Are Born With Blue Eyes</h3>
				<p>That's right! All kittens have blue eyes when they are newborns, even cats that have the darkest brown eyes!

			<h3>Kittens Socialize In Order To Learn</h3>
				<p>It is a known fact that kittens love to scratch and play with other cats, but why is that? Well, we got our answer below from Facts.net</p>
				<blockquote cite="https://facts.net/kitten-facts/">
				For example, 3-4 months after birth, is the peak time for interaction with other kittens, 
				so at this stage kittens play intensively together. At around 5 months of age, on the other hand, 
				solitary behaviors become more important, and kittens will spend time developing and practicing their 
				skills in stalking and hunting.

			<h3>Kittens Learn To Meow Very Earn On</h3>
				<p>Baby cats start meowing very early on because this is how they call for their mother and how they let her know
				that they're hungry! They will even sometimes hiss if somethng unfamiliar gets too close. This is their form of protection,
				and their moews and hisses will definitely alert anyone nearby.</p>
